# casino-dealer
This was an assignment in our Object-Oriented Programming module in Second Year.
We had to implement the methods in `ConcreteDeck`, `ConcreteHand`, and `Card`, as well as the `deal` method in `ConcreteDealer`.

My original handed-in version explicitly called `.toString()` in one or two places where objects would have been automatically cast to strings using that method behind-the-scenes anyway.
I have removed it in the version I uploaded to GitHub.
